# Rainbow Passage Remake

The project is intended to remake the website front-end using React and modern web design best practices.

Rainbow Passage has a flawed website:

- Each page is a different style.
- Some pages have different or missing navigation.
- It does not follow usability best practices.

This makes the charity look less professional and discourages user interaction.

## Goals

The success of this project will be based on the educational and practical value it provides.

### Official Recognition

To have the app distributed and recognized, if not used, by the Rainbow Passage charity (a response by email).

### React Experience

The final result of a working font-end that accurately reflects the contents of the original Rainbow Passage website.

## Scope

This is meant to be a personal project, not intended to take the place of living circumstances such as current work or seasonal events. Non-essential additions will be limited.

### In Scope

The website is meant to be a more clear and usable version of the original website.

* A majority or all of the old website contents.
* Mock forms for various tasks.
* Photos and videos from the Pride community, when available and useful.
* Necessary optimizations needed to make the website usable by the charity if desirable.

### Out of Scope

There will be self-imposed limits on the design, in order to avoid stepping on existing charity contributors and avoid having the design invalidated over time.

* Data persstance of any kind.
* Access to external services (web APIs or integrations).
* Unproven web technologies.

## Schedule

There is no hard deadline for this project, rather it is limited to the time required to express the contents of the original design (made up of 4 main pages). It will be divided into X major parts:

- Research and planning.
- Wireframing and rough prototypes.
- Minimum viable product (rough website).
- Finalization.
- Distribution (providing to Rainbow Passage).

A ProjectLibre Gantt schedule named Rainbow Passage Schedule.pod is provided and will be maintained and expanded throughout the project based on these major parts.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
